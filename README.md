This section covers the basics of Azure networking, including virtual machines (VMs), IP addresses, network interface cards (NICs), subnets, virtual networks (VNets), and network security groups (NSGs).

**Key Concepts**

**Virtual Machines (VMs)** 💻
- **VMs**: Virtual machines are the core compute resources in Azure.

**IP Addresses**
- **Private IP Address**: Used for internal communication within a VNet.
- **Public IP Address**: Used for communication with the internet.

**Network Interface Cards (NICs)** 📡
- **NIC**: A virtual network interface for Azure VMs.
- **IP Configuration**: Supports private and public IPs.
- **Subnets and VNets**: Linked to subnets within a VNet.
- **Accelerated Networking**: Enhances performance.
- **Security**: Can use NSGs for traffic control.

**Subnets** 🔗
- **Subnets**: Segments within a VNet to organize and secure resources.
- **Smallest CIDR**: The smallest CIDR for a subnet in Azure is /29.

**Virtual Networks (VNets)** 🌐
- **Regional Service**: Scoped to a specific Azure region but can connect across regions using Virtual Network Peering.
- **CIDR Notation**: Specify a custom private IP address space using CIDR, e.g., 10.0.0.0/16.
- **RFC1918 Address Space**: Microsoft recommends using private IP ranges from RFC1918:
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0/12
  - 192.168.0.0/16

**Network Security Groups (NSGs)** 🔒
- **NSGs**: Filter network traffic to and from Azure resources within a VNet.
- **Association**: Can be linked to subnets or individual NICs.
- **Security Rules**: Contain rules to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- **Default Rules**: Include default rules with the lowest priority.
- **Application Security Groups (ASGs)**: Simplify management by grouping VMs.
- **Flow Logs**: Provide information about allowed or denied traffic for monitoring.

### 🔸Network Security Groups (NSG) and Application Security Groups (ASG)

**Network Security Groups (NSG)** 🔒
NSGs are used to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources within a Virtual Network (VNet). They contain security rules that allow or deny inbound and outbound traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces (NICs), providing granular control over network security.

**Application Security Groups (ASG)** 🏷️
ASGs simplify the management of NSGs by allowing you to group VMs and define network security policies based on these groups. Instead of manually inputting private IP addresses into the NSG, you can create an ASG as a label. The app team can then apply this ASG to their VMs, streamlining the process.

**Scenario: Simplifying NSG Management with ASG**
Imagine a DB VM in Azure sitting privately in one VNet. Four app VMs from other VNets need to connect to this DB VM. Instead of inputting all the private IP addresses into the NSG, the DB team can create an ASG. The app team applies this ASG to their VMs. Finally, the DB team configures the NSG to allow communication from the ASG, eliminating the need for IP addresses and simplifying future workload management.

By using ASGs, you can efficiently manage network security and reduce the complexity of maintaining NSG rules.

</div>

**Scenario: 1 DB VM and 4 App VMs**

**📂 ASGs**
- **DbASG**: Group for the database VM.
- **AppASG**: Group for the four application VMs.

**🔒 NSG Rules**
1. **Allow HTTP traffic to `AppASG`**:
   - **NSG**: Add this rule to the NSG associated with the **application VMs' subnet or network interfaces**.
   - **Purpose**: It allows inbound HTTP traffic to the VMs in the `AppASG`.

2. **Allow SQL traffic from `AppASG` to `DbASG`**:
   - **NSG**: Add this rule to the NSG associated with the **database VM's subnet or network interface**.
   - **Purpose**: It allows inbound SQL traffic from the VMs in the `AppASG` to the VM in the `DbASG`.

This setup ensures that your application VMs can receive HTTP traffic and communicate with the database VM over SQL.
