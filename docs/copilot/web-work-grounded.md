##  WEB-GROUNDED in Microsoft Copilot

AI models like **GPT-4o** are trained on large datasets, but their knowledge only goes up to a certain point (for example, mid-2024). This means they **cannot automatically know real-time events or the latest updates**.

**Web-grounded capability** solves this limitation by connecting Copilot to the internet through **Bing Search**. When you ask a question that requires current information, Copilot:

1. **Searches the web using Bing** to find the most relevant and up-to-date content
2. **Analyzes and filters** that information for accuracy and trustworthiness
3. **Combines** the fresh data with the model existing knowledge
4. **Generates a response** that is both smart and current

### Why It Matters

Without web grounding, Copilot would only rely on static training data. With this feature, you get answers that reflect **todays reality**, such as:
- Latest product updates
- Current market trends
- Breaking news or recent events

##  WORK-GROUNDED in Microsoft Copilot

While web grounding brings in public information, **work grounding** focuses on your **organizations internal data**. Copilot uses **Microsoft Graph** to securely access:
- Emails
- Files
- Chats
- Meetings
- Other enterprise resources

This allows Copilot to:
1. **Understand your work context** (projects, documents, conversations)
2. **Combine internal data with model knowledge** for personalized answers
3. Provide **relevant, secure, and compliant responses** tailored to your organization

### Why It Matters

Work grounding ensures Copilot is not just smart, but **context-aware**. Examples:
- Summarizing your recent meetings
- Drafting emails based on your companys tone and policies
- Answering questions using internal documents and resources

## Summary

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Web-Grounded** | Brings in **current public knowledge** from the internet |
| **Work-Grounded** | Uses **your organizations data** for personalized, secure answers |

Together, these capabilities make Microsoft Copilot powerful, accurate, and context-aware.
