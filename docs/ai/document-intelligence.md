Azure AI Document Intelligence is a cutting-edge technology that simplifies how businesses handle their documents. With its advanced features, you can customize the processing of various document types. Here's a closer look:

## 📄 Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Azure's OCR technology converts images and handwritten notes into searchable, editable text. It recognizes text in different languages and formats, paving the way for more advanced processing.

## 📦 Prebuilt Models

These ready-to-use models allow for quick data extraction from standard documents like invoices, receipts, and business cards.

## 🛠️ Custom Projects

For specialized needs, Azure offers tools to create tailored solutions:

**Classification**: Use Azure's machine learning to categorize documents, making it easier to organize and find important information.

**Custom Extraction**: Extract specific data according to your needs. There are two methods:
- **Neural Model**: Recommended for its ability to use neural networks to understand and extract data, adapting to different document layouts. This model is highly effective because it can interpret documents with a level of understanding comparable to human cognition, making it robust against variations in document formats.
- **Template Model**: Ideal for structured documents, this method uses predefined templates to ensure accurate data extraction.

## 🔄 Composed Models

Combine different custom models into one for processing multiple document types or using various extraction methods.

Azure AI Document Intelligence helps turn your documents into valuable assets, improving decision-making and efficiency. Embrace the Azure ecosystem to fully unlock the potential of your documents with unmatched customization and intelligence.
